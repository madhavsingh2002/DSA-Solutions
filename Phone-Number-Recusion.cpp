    Backtracking approach
The idea is to find all possible combinations of letters using backtracking. 
Backtracking is an algorithm to find all possible solutions by exploring all potential candidates. If the current solution does not turn out to be a solution or is not possibly the last solution, this algorithm backtracks and makes some changes on the previous steps.

 

Algorithm: 

Letâ€™s say we have a backtrack function, combinationsHelper(combination, nextDigits) which takes the ongoing letter combination and next digits (which we need to map to letters) as its arguments.
Base Case: If there are no more digits to check, that means that the current                         combination is done.
If there are still digits to check :
a. Iterate over the letters mapping the next available digit. 

b. Append the current letter to the current combination and proceed to check the next digits.

Time Complexity
O(3^N * 4^M), where N is the number of digits in the string S that maps to 3 letters and M is the number of digits in the string S that maps to 4 letters.

 

Numbers {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8} map to 3 letters and numbers {7, 9} map to 4 letters. Generating combinations of a string of length L takes K^L time, where K is the number of letters that each digit maps to. Thus, the final time complexity will be O(3^N * 4^M).

Space Complexity
O(3^N * 4^M), where N is the number of digits in the string S that maps to 3 letters and M is the number of digits in the string S that maps to 4 letters.

Since we are storing all the possible combinations, thus the final space complexity is O(3^N * 4^M).
